        <p>
            <strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All your financial data, including budgets, expenses, assets, and liabilities, is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your financial data on our servers.

        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous usage statistics to help us improve the app, such as app crashes, feature usage, and performance metrics. This information does not identify you personally.
        </p>
        
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        
        <p>

            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the data that we collect and process. Your financial data remains on your device and is not accessible to us.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        
        <p>
            Our app may use third-party services for analytics and crash reporting. These services may collect anonymous usage data subject to their own privacy policies. We carefully select these services and limit the data shared with them.
        </p>
        
        <h2>No Data Sharing</h2>
        
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to third parties. Your financial data remains private and stored only on your device.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>
            Our Service is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our servers immediately.
        </p>
